This date follows Ubisoft's standard quarterly release cycle, which typically lasts around 90 days. <br><br>The transition to Year 11 Season 1 will begin with a scheduled maintenance period, usually starting at <strong>09:00 AM ET (14:00 UTC)</strong>. During this downtime, ranked matchmaking will be disabled for approximately 60 to 90 minutes while the servers are updated. Players should ensure they complete their final ranked matches at least 30 minutes before the cutoff to avoid abandon penalties.",

However, your hidden <strong>Matchmaking Rating (MMR)</strong> does <em>not</em> fully reset. This 'Skill Rating' persists and helps the system match you against players of similar skill level during your placement matches. This mechanic ensures that Champion-level players do not get matched against true Copper players during the first week of the new season.",

    "FAQ": {
        "title": "Frequently Asked Questions",
        "q1": "When does the current Rainbow Six Siege season end?",
        "a1": "Rainbow Six Siege Operation Tenfold Pursuit (Year 10 Season 4) is targeted to end on <strong>March 3, 2026</strong>. This date is based on the in-game Battle Pass timer and Ubisoft's historical release patterns for Year 10. Dates may shift by 24-48 hours depending on technical stability and last-minute delays.",
        "q2": "What happens to my Rank and MMR?",
        "a2": "When Y11S1 launches, your visual rank resets to Copper V. However, your hidden MMR (Skill Rating) carries over. If you finished High Platinum or Diamond, you will gain significantly more RP (Rank Points) per win at the start of the next season, allowing you to return to your 'true rank' faster. This is known as 'RP Gain/Loss Disparity'.",
        "q3": "Do Battle Pass tokens carry over?",
        "a3": "No. <strong>Battle Pass tokens do not carry over</strong> to the next season. You must spend all your earned tokens on Battle Pass rewards before the timer hits zero. Any unspent tokens will disappear. However, unused Bravo Tickets typically remain in your inventory.",
        "q4": "Is Cross-Progression active?",
        "a4": "Yes. Your cosmetics, renown, credits, and operators are shared across all platforms (PC, Xbox, PlayStation) as long as your accounts are linked to the same <strong>Ubisoft Connect</strong> ID. However, rank progression is separate between PC and Console pools."
