        "a1": "Rainbow Six Siege Operation Tenfold Pursuit (Year 10 Season 4) is expected to end on <strong>March 3, 2026</strong>. The servers typically go offline for maintenance at 9:00 AM ET / 14:00 UTC.",
        "q2": "What happens when the timer reaches zero?",
        "a2": "When the countdown ends, the game servers usually enter a maintenance period for approximately 60-90 minutes. After maintenance, the relevant platform update (PC, PlayStation, Xbox) will be available for download.",
        "q3": "Will I keep my rank next season?",
        "a3": "No, your visible rank resets with every new season. However, your hidden MMR (Matchmaking Rating) is not fully reset, which helps determine how quickly you can rank up in the new season."
